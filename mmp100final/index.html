        <h1>Love at first sight</h1>
        <h2>By Christian Simmonds</h2>
        <p>Feeling sad when you see a disabled animal? Then come on down to Krazy Kevins located on Fordham Road 1542 Bronx, NY to adopt a loving disabled Critter. To show how the love works, heres a short comic that i drew on my free time.</p>
        <p>In the comic,there is a boy that is looking for a new puppy.However he dosent want any puppy dog, he wanted something different. He stumbled upon a puppy that is missing one leg. Once he sees how happy the puppy is to see him, the boy immediately falls in love with the disabled pup.</p>
